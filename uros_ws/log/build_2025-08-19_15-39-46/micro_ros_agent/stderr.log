Cloning into 'xrceagent'...
Switched to a new branch 'TF-M-test'
[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/local/share/cmake-3.27/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (tinyxml2)
  does not match the name of the calling package (TinyXML2).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/modules/FindTinyXML2.cmake:40 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
